This PHP script is designed to demonstrate Oauth 2.0 with Constant
Contact with a little code as possible.

To use the script, copy it into a web directory configured with PHP, 
set the $api_key and $client_secret variables to match those of your 
API, and set the $redirect_uri value to the full uri for this script, 
including the script filename. In order for Oauth 2 to succeed, the 
redirect_uri in your Constant Contact API settings needs to match this 
redirect_uri value exactly.

The script includes a simple Cookie-based login/logout capability. It 
tests for authentication cookie, and if it is not present, proceeds 
with Oauth 2 authentication, and sets an authentication cookie that 
stores username and access token. The logout function calls a small
external deauth.php script that sets the cookie expiry to the past to 
destroy the cookie, then redirects to this script again and restarts 
Oauth 2 sequence.
